Systematic addition of a small molecule to an existing cluster/molecule. It is discussed in detail in this paper:

"Hydration of Atmospheric Molecular Clusters: A New Method for Systematic Configurational Sampling"<br>

Overall, it's a very nice and convenient tool I hope to play around with more.

# Typical use

`python ../molecule_adding.py --fibonacci_points 1 --output dimer --header header.txt --format ".xyz" solute.xyz solvent.xyz`

* fibonacci_points is 5 by default, but it was creating a much larger number of isomers than
  necessary for my test case
* including a header file with number of atoms and a comment line to comply with Cartesian XYZ format helps.
